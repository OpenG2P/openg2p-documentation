# Role-Based Access Control

## Introduction

OpenG2P platform defines role-based access control (RBAC) to authorize users of the OpenG2P platform to access views and menus according to their roles. RBAC also prevents unauthorized access to the OpenG2P system and safeguards beneficiary data from malicious actors.

## OpenG2P role-based access control

In the OpenG2P platform, a group is synonymous with a role. Each group has a list of platform users assigned to it. OpenG2P provides a large variety of pre-defined groups (roles). The System Administrator can also create custom groups from scratch or inherit from pre-defined groups. To learn the steps to create a custom group, click [here](../guides/user-guides/create-entitlement-manager-role.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
The term 'group' here should not be confused with the term for group of registrants. The term 'group' in the current context defines a role for the OpenG2P platform users.

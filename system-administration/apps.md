## Introduction

The applications provided by the OpenG2P platform, Odoo platform, and third parties can be managed using the Apps menu. System administrators can use the menus for these activities:

1. View a list of pre-installed platform and third-party apps
2. View theme store
3. Discover new apps from the app store
4. View the list and status of app updates
5. Schedule updates of apps

Program/System administrators can install new apps for Proxy Means Test, mail configuration, and SMS gateway configuration, to name a few.

# Voucher

## Introduction

A voucher is a digitally signed document (with a QR code) or letter of guarantee against which a beneficiary can avail a service without having to pay for it, or is entitled to withdraw cash.

Vouchers may be issued in several forms:

1. Paper-based with a letter and QR code
2. Verifiable Credential (VC) on a smartphone

# Document Sharing Infra

## Context

The thoughts here are inspired by a request from the Philippines AICS team on the ability to share user-uploaded documents across departments without users having to upload the same repeatedly. Further, the proof of verification of the document by one agency should be available to whoever the document is shared with. The consumer of the document (a government department, for example) may further verify the same. Such a chain of verifications must be available to the consumers of the document. An important point to note is that users will mostly upload scanned PDF copies of their documents, like a medical prescription. These documents will not be available in a digital format until they are gradually converted to digital. This conversion process may occur either at the source or at some point in the chain, either through manual transcription or by utilizing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology.

Document sharing is not different from general data sharing. Immediately coming to mind are architectural systems such as [X-ROAD](https://x-road.global/), [Open Banking](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/) and the recently announced [DEPA](https://depa.world/).

Although it may take several years for a country to develop and implement the above mechanisms, the goal here is to create a document-sharing system that can be put into action in the short term. This system should be in accordance with the fundamental principles of data sharing and should seamlessly work alongside established data-sharing standards."&#x20;

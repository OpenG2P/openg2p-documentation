## DB design

For attestation and change log maintain following tables:

* **Change log table**
  * id of the field
  * changed datetime
  * changed by
  * previous value
  * new value
  * comments
* **Attestation table**
  * id of the field
  * status (NEW, ATTESTED, REJECTED ..)
  * attested by
  * attestation datetime
  * comments

The `status` fields will come from buisness processes and real use cases.

## User interface

UI required for the following:

* Person to login, view and update records
* Admin to view and attest fields with comments
* Download of CSV for chosen fields of registry
* Upload of attested CSV

## Bulk attestation

We should be able to download a CSV from the registry, apply bulk attestation, and upload back the CSV.  The upload should trigger update of registry, change log and attestation table

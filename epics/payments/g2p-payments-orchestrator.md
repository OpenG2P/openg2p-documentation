# G2P Payments Orchestrator

## Context

Enabling digital payments in a country requires several technology components, standards, legal frameworks and stakeholder agreements to come together. Countries across the globe stand at different maturity levels when it comes to digital payment infrastructure. In the context of social protection programs, the focus is more on the government to person payment channels for direct benefit transfer (DBT), emergency relief cash transfer, conditional cash transfer etc. It should be possible to connect these payment channels to systems like OpenG2P that can automatically trigger digital cash transfer.&#x20;

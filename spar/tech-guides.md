### Persistent Entities in openg2p-spar-self-service-api

dfsp\_level and dfsp\_level\_values - are static tables that contain the information pertaining to the Banks (and other financial service providers), their branches.  The use of these two tables are explained below using examples

#### dfsp\_levels

<table><thead><tr><th width="78">id</th><th width="227">name</th><th width="246">level_type - ENUM</th><th>parent</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Bank</td><td>bank</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Branch</td><td>branch</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Account number</td><td>account</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table>

The above data indicates that, to fully express the Financial Address of a Beneficiary's bank account, the self service platform needs to capture 3 attributes for the Financial Address, viz. Bank, Branch & Account

Similarly for a Mobile Number based Wallet, we can think of the following dfsp\_level configuration

<table><thead><tr><th width="61">id</th><th width="279">name</th><th width="224">level_type - ENUM</th><th>parent</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>4</td><td>Mobile Wallet Service Provider</td><td>mobile_wallet_provider</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Mobile number</td><td>mobile_number</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table>

For a Email Address based Wallet, we can have the following dfsp\_level configuration

<table><thead><tr><th width="61">id</th><th width="279">name</th><th width="224">level_type - ENUM</th><th>parent</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6</td><td>Email Wallet Service Provider</td><td>email_wallet_provider</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Email address</td><td>email_address</td><td>6</td></tr></tbody></table>

The self-service-ui uses the api - "get\_levels (parent)" to paint the UI fields to capture the input for these attributes - parent = 0, will provide the first level for the FA hierarchy

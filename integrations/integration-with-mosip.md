# Integration with MOSIP

## Introduction

OpenG2P integrates with MOSIP to provide following functions:

1. Tokenise [registry](../modules/secure-registry/) using MOSIP ID.
2. Provide user login using MOSIP ID on the [Self Service Portal](../modules/self-service-portal.md).

## Tokenisation

Tokenisation is achieved by connecting to MOSIP Token Seeder&#x20;

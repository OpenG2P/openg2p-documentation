# Integration with MOSIP

## Introduction

OpenG2P integrates with MOSIP to verify the UIN/VIDs provided by individuals as part of the registration process. As a result of the verification, OpenG2P receives a unique token against an individual's UIN/VID along with KYC data. This data is stored in the registry.

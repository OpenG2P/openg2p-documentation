# Writing Guidelines For How-To Guides

1. Capitalize the first letter of every word in the guide title.
2. Use second-person pronouns i.e. you, your, etc. in the instructions.
3. It is mandatory to do spelling and grammatical corrections using tools such as Grammarly.
4. Use italicized fonts for UI elements i.e. dashboard names, button labels, information fields, etc.
5. Use the exact name and case for the UI elements.
6. Use quotes for a phrase/word if the phrase/word has to be represented as is.
7. Provide a link at the first mention of a new/different topic. For example, if the guide is talking about installing the SmartScanner app, and the WireGuard app is mentioned, then provide the link for WireGuard.&#x20;
8. Use clear and crisp images.

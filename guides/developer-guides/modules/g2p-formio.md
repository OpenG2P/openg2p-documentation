* Version control for forms.
* Integration with other OpenG2P modules for data processing

Limitations:

* Real-time collaboration on form design is not supported.
* Complex logic and calculations within forms may require custom development.

### Design notes

Salient Design Features

* User-friendly form design interface.
* Extensible architecture to support future form field types.
* Versioning system to track changes in form design.

Design Decisions

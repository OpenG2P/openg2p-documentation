# Interoperability

At the very onset OpenG2P team has been cognizant of the importance of working with DPGs and other external components without having to develop proprietary and custom methods of connecting to other systems. Interoperability is a fundamental design principle in OpenG2P's thought process. We have been an active participant in interoperability efforts like G2P Connect, DCI, and GovStack. The following standard interfaces have been implemented.

1. [G2P Connect Disbursement APIs](https://g2p-connect.github.io/specs/release/html/disburse\_core\_api\_v1.0.0.html)&#x20;
2. [G2P Connect Registry APIs](https://g2p-connect.github.io/specs/release/html/registry\_core\_api\_v1.0.0.html)

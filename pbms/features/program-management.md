# Program Management

## Introduction

OpenG2P platform's program management is a sequence of processes encompassing program creation to deciding entitlement for the beneficiaries. Digitalization of these processes offers multiple benefits such as ease of administration, agility of operations, data empowerment and so on.

OpenG2P platform's program management enables program managers to perform various activities.  The activities are:

* Define and manage multiple programs
* Manage program lifecycle&#x20;
* Target both individual and groups&#x20;
* Define program disbursement cycles

## OpenG2P Program Management

In OpenG2P, program management comprises of certain process to make programs and its benefits to reach the eligible individual/groups. A program manager must perform the configuration, activation  and so on to manage the program efficiently.  A program has the phases such as,

| Process                                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Program lifecycle](program-management.md#program-lifecycle)                 | <ul><li>Program creation</li><li>Program activation</li><li>Program closure</li></ul>                                                                                                          |
| [Configuration of Managers](program-management.md#configuration-of-managers) |  A program manager configures the relevant managers required for a program                                                                                                                     |
| [PMT configuration](program-management.md#pmt-configuration)                 | A program manger configures Proxy Means Test (PMT) to validate the eligible individual/groups to enrol into a program                                                                          |
| [Map portal form](program-management.md#map-portal-form)                     | In self-service portal form, the individual/groups provides the required information to eligible for a program. Mapping of  the self-service portal form becomes integral parts of a program   |

### Program lifecycle

In Open G2P, a program is a scheme created to assist an individual/group to avail benefits given by  the government of their country. An Individual/group must undergo sequence of verification process to avail the benefits.&#x20;

After the verification process is successful, an individual/group become eligible to enroll in the program and are referred to as beneficiaries. Once the program is activated to an individual/group, he/she can receive the allotted benefits.

&#x20;For each program, there is a lifecycle. The program lifecycle comes to end for an individual/group after they receive the benefits delivered to them.  The benefits can be delivered in single cycle or multiple cycles depends on the program lifecycle.

A program (scheme) comes to closure after the benefits reaches an individual/group. It can also be retrieved once the program lifecycle is activated.

## Configuration of Managers

A program is composed of various managers, each of which configures the parameters for a specific program such as eligibility determination, deduplication, notification, cycle management, entitlement management and payment management.&#x20;

In OpenG2P, in each programs' configuration tab, you can find the various managers, such as, [Eligibility Managers](eligibility/), [Deduplication Managers](deduplication.md), [Notification Managers](notifications.md), Program Manager, Cycle Manager, [Entitlement Manager](entitlement.md), and Payment Manager.

## PMT Configuration

In OpenG2P, a program manager configures the PMT to validate the income and poverty status of individual/groups using data on basic household materials, to enrol his/her to a program.

## Map Portal Form

In OpenG2P, mapping a self-service portal form to a program is essential for streamlining the application process for beneficiaries. This functionality allows beneficiaries to access and complete the forms when applying for a specific program. The mapped forms become integral parts of the program, ensuring that all required information is collected efficiently and accurately, facilitating better management and processing of applications. This integration enhances the user experience for applicants and improves the administrative efficiency of program management.

## Managing multiple programs

OpenG2P platform has a backend office application for program administrators. The platform allows multiple programs to run in parallel. These programs enroll the registrants from the same registry database. Its program management module offers a rich set of functions for enrolment, eligibility criteria, program cycles, entitlement, and notifications.

## Program disbursement cycles

OpenG2P platform allows the Program Manager, the Cycle Manager, the Program Manager to create multiple cycles and disburse benefits. Social benefit delivery programs for unemployment benefits, pensions, and scholarships are cyclic in nature and disburse payments in multiple cycles.

# Program Life Cycle

A program is a scheme created to assist an individual/group to avail benefits given by the government of their country. An Individual/group must undergo sequence of verification process to avail the benefits.&#x20;

* **Create a program:** A program manager or an administrator creates a program.
* **Configure managers:** A program manager configures the relevant manager to a program, such as eligibility managers, deduplication manager, notification managers, program manager, cycle manager, entitlement manager and payment manager.
* **Allocate fund:** A program manager allocates funds to a program
* **Activate a program:** In this phase, after the eligibility manager completes the verification process,   an individual/group becomes eligible to enroll in a program and is referred to as a beneficiary. Once the program is activated for an individual/group, he/she can receive the allocated entitlements.
* **Close a program:** A program lifecycle ends for an individual/group after they receive the entitlements mentioned in their enrolled program are delivered to them.  The benefits can be delivered in single cycle or multiple cycles depends on the program disbursement cycle.
* **Re-activate a program:** A program (scheme) ends after the entitlement reaches the individual/group. It can also be re-activated once the program managers invoke the program.

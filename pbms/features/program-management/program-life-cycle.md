* Create a program: A program manager or an administrator creates a program.
* Configure managers: A program manager configures the relevant manger to a program, such as eligibility managers, deduplication manager, notification managers, program manager, cycle manager, entitlement manager and payment manager.
* Allocate fund: A program manager allots fund to a program
* Activate a program: In this phase, after the eligibility manager completes the verification process,  then an individual/group become eligible to enroll in a program and are referred to as beneficiaries. Once the program is activated to an individual/group, he/she can receive the allotted entitlements.
* Close a program: A program lifecycle comes to end for an individual/group, after they receive the entitlements which are mentioned in their enrolled program are delivered to them.  The benefits can be delivered in single cycle or multiple cycles depends on the program disbursement cycle.
* Re-activate a program: A program (scheme) comes to closure after the entitlement  reaches individual/group. It can also be re-activated once the program managers evoke/enable the program.

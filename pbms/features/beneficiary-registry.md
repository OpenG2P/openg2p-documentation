# Beneficiary Registry

## Introduction

The concept of a beneficiary registry involves maintaining a database or record system that contains information about individuals or entities who are beneficiaries of a particular program, service, or assistance. This registry typically includes details such as the beneficiary's identity, eligibility criteria, participation in programs, entitlements, and any benefits received.

The Beneficiary Registry (BR) resides in PBMS and contains the following&#x20;

* Beneficiary to Program mapping
* Entitlement of beneficiaries
* Status of disbursement

BR may be queried to know about all the programs that a beneficiary is enrolled into.  Further, information on the amount of assistance (cash, in-kind) along with disbursement status may be queried.

## Data share

Beneficiary program data can be shared to external systems via APIs.

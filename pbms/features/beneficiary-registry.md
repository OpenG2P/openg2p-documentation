# Beneficiary Registry

The Beneficiary Registry (BR) resides in PBMS and contains the following&#x20;

* Beneficiary to Program mapping
* Entitlement of beneficiaries
* Status of disbursement

BR may be queried to know about all the programs that a beneficiary is enrolled into.  Further, information on the amount of assistance (cash, in-kind) along with disbursement status may be queried.

## Data share

Beneficiary program data can be shared to external systems via APIs.

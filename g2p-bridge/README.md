# G2P Bridge

The G2P Bridge subsystem bridges the upstream Program Management (aka MIS systems) modules with the downstream Sponsor Bank to effect large scale / high volume beneficiary transfers.&#x20;

Being a G2P system (not a P2G, P2P, P2M, etc), the platform does not desire to offer high performance and real time transfers, since these features are not typically required in a G2P transfer chain. Rather, the platform is designed to operate asynchronously and emphasises on high volumes, ease of use, low cost of operations and efficient reconciliation.

The following figure shows how the G2P Bridge subsystem fits into the overall G2P landscape

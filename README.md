[OpenG2P](https://openg2p.org) is an open-source social benefits registry and delivery platform that enables governments and humanitarian organisations the ability to deliver digital cash transfers and critical benefits directly to those who need them. It offers interoperable components for digitizing and automating service delivery and enables inclusive and efficient delivery of benefits.&#x20;

OpenG2P is a Digital Public Good recognised by the [DPGA](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) and a significant building block of a country's Digital Public Infrastructure ([DPI](https://docs.cdpi.dev/dpi/readme)). In order to digitize the process of the social benefits delivery chain, countries can augment their existing systems with OpenG2P's modular and interoperable technology. OpenG2P facilitates the existing systems to operate without impacting their present build and the process.&#x20;

The OpenG2P code is currently available on [GitHub](https://github.com/openg2p) under MPL 2.0 licence. It is currently housed in the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore ([IIITB](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/)), a non-profit research university.

OpenG2P offers several modules and tools to digitize the processes of the social benefits delivery chain

OpenG2P is built on a bedrock of good practices and principles that drive our work towards empowering populations to reach out their social benefits around the world through technology.\

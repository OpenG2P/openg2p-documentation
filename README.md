Version 0.7.0 of OpenG2P was built over the original (legacy) version of OpenG2P. This version has been primarily used for pilots and demonstrations. From a code-base perspective, this version is **not compatible** with 1.x version of OpenG2P.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Countries adopting OpenG2P must use 1.x and above.

[OpenG2P](https://openg2p.org) OpenG2P is an open-source social benefits registry and delivery platform that enables governments and humanitarian organisations the ability to deliver digital cash transfers and critical benefits directly to those who need them. It offers interoperable components for digitizing and automating service delivery and enables inclusive and efficient delivery of benefits.&#x20;

OpenG2P is a Digital Public Good recognised by the [DPGA](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/) and a significant building block of a country's digital public infrastructure ([DPI](https://docs.cdpi.dev/dpi/readme)). Its modular and interoperable technology augments existing systems in countries, without discarding what works or starting from scratch.&#x20;

The OpenG2P code is currently available on [GitHub](https://github.com/openg2p) under an MPL 2.0 licence. It is currently housed in the International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore ([IIITB](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/)), a non-profit research university.

OpenG2P offers several modules and tools to digitize processes of the social benefit delivery chain

OpenG2P is built on a bedrock of good practices and principles that drive our work towards empowering populations around the world through technology.\

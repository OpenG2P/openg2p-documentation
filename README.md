The platform offers interoperable components for digitizing and automating service delivery and enables inclusive and efficient delivery of benefits.&#x20;

OpenG2P was set up with the vision to accelerate social protection, financial inclusion, and digital development. These are the guiding principles behind the OpenG2P vision.

OpenG2P is a Digital Public Good ([DPG](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/openg2p.html)) recognized by the DPGA and has received contributions and support from multiple organisations and implementers. The project, co-founded by the Government of Sierra Leone and UNDP and supported by [Mifos](https://mifos.org) in the early stages, is now housed in[ IIIT Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/), a not-for-profit university in India.

The platform offers people-facing processes such as onboarding into schemes, identity verification, and cash transfers to their bank accounts. It also incorporates government department-facing features such as the creation of registries and beneficiary lists, eligibility checks, scheme definition, payment disbursement and reconciliation.

# Print the Approved Entitlements

In PBMS, registered applicants are entitled to the program's benefits for which they are enrolled as eligible beneficiaries. The PBMS module is required to compile and maintain reports on the entitled beneficiaries due to the enormous number of eligible beneficiaries receiving entitlements.&#x20;

In order to provide the users with a comprehensive list of all the approved entitlements, the feature _**Print the Approved Entitlements**_ is developed. The Print/Export button is designed to make it simple for the users to effectively print or export data. It will only be accessible following the approval of entitlements, and it will then continue to function.

Using this feature, as a user, he/she can

* view a list of beneficiaries who are entitled to program's benefits.&#x20;
* easily manage and verify the approved entitlements.&#x20;

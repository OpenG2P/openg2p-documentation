# ðŸ’µ Cash Transfers

## Introduction

Digitalization of cash transfers in social benefits delivery programs can make the benefit disbursement swift, efficient, safe, and secure. Digitalization of payment processes end-to-end can be achieved by providing these two key functions:

1. Automation of backend administration for payments: to save costs for governments by reducing leakages, improving transparency, and preventing errors, fraud, and corruption
2. Disbursement of benefits using digital payments: to provide convenience, ease of access, safety, and choice of encashment to the beneficiaries

Expansion of social protection programs from 2020 onwards

* Digital payments are the most preferred method of delivering cash transfers
* Wide variation across country expenditure on social protection
  * 1.1% of GDP in low-income countries vs. 16.4% in high-income countries
{% endhint %}

OpenG2P platform implements both these functions to provide ease of payment administration and a human-centric approach to benefit disbursements. The platform's Payments module consists of several functions to efficiently execute digital and mobile payments to the beneficiaries and report the status. Payments are generally executed in [cycles](broken-reference/) and [batches](payment-batches.md).

OpenG2P platform can be used to disburse payments for various use cases:

* Social protection
* Universal basic income
* Cash incentives
* Child allowances
* School financing

As technology demonstrations, OpenG2P offers payment connectors for [Mojaloop](https://mojaloop.io/) and[ Mifos Payment Hub](https://payments.mifos.org/) with the flexibility to create custom connectors specific to the [payment rails](payment-rails.md) of a country.

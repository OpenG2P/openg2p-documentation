# ðŸ’µ Payment Management

## Introduction

The Payments module consists of several functions to efficiently execute cash transfers to the beneficiaries and report the status of payments. Out of the box, OpenG2P offers payment connectors for [Mojaloop](https://mojaloop.io/) and [GSMA Mobile Money](https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/mobile-money/) with flexibility to create custom connectors specific to the payment rails of a country.

Payments are generally executed in [cycles](payment-cycles.md) and [batches](payment-batches.md).

## Introduction

Digitalization of payments in social benefits delivery programs can make the benefit disbursement swift, efficient, safe, and secure. Digitalization of payment processes end-to-end can be achieved by providing these two key functions:

1. Automation of backend administration for payments: to save costs for governments by reducing leakages, improving transparency, and preventing errors, fraud, and corruption
2. Disbursement of benefits using digital payments: to provide convenience, ease of access, safety, and choice of encashment to the beneficiaries

OpenG2P platform implements both these functions to provide ease of payment administration and a human-centric approach to benefit disbursements. The platform's Payments module consists of several functions to efficiently execute digital and mobile payments to the beneficiaries and report the status. As technology demonstrations, OpenG2P offers payment connectors for [Mojaloop](https://mojaloop.io/) and[ Mifos Payment Hub](https://payments.mifos.org/) with the flexibility to create custom connectors specific to the [payment rails](payment-rails.md) of a country.

Payments are generally executed in [cycles](broken-reference) and [batches](payment-batches.md).

# ðŸ’µ Payment Management

## Introduction

The Payments module consists of several functions to efficiently execute cash transfers to the beneficiaries and report the status of payments. As technology demonstrations, OpenG2P offers payment connectors for [Mojaloop](https://mojaloop.io/) and[ Mifos Payment Hub](https://payments.mifos.org/) with the flexibility to create custom connectors specific to the payment rails of a country.

Payments are generally executed in [cycles](broken-reference) and [batches](payment-batches.md).

# Payment Batches

## Introduction

In each [program cycle](../beneficiary-management/disbursement-cycles.md), the payment transactions can be done in batches. There could be several reasons for batching the payments. The transaction limits may be imposed by payment switch, [DFSP](broken-reference/) or any other entity in the payments chain.

# Entitlement Voucher

## Introduction

Many programs disburse cash and other benefits through authorized service providers. These service providers provide cash at the counter, medical assistance, and other such assistance. These service providers need proof from the beneficiary about their entitlement amount and issuing authority.

OpenG2P eases this process with entitlement voucher configuration with built-in support for entitlement voucher templates along with a QR code. To learn the steps for configuring the entitlement voucher template, click here.

The beneficiary carries this entitlement voucher to the service provider, who scans the voucher for the authenticity of the voucher, beneficiary details, entitlement amount, validity time of entitlement, and supporting documents.

## Reimbursing Service Provider

After serving the beneficiary, the service provider will raise a reimbursement request. OpenG2P provides a reference implementation for a [Service Provider Portal](../../../guides/user-guides/submit-reimbursement-using-the-service-provider-portal.md) that can be used by the service providers to submit reimbursements for their services. These requests are listed in the reimbursements view of the OpenG2P platform under reimbursements. Program administrators can view these requests, validate them, and issue the payment to the service providers.

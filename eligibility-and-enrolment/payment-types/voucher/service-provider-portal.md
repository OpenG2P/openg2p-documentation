# Service Provider Portal

## Introduction

Service Provider Portal allows a service provider serving the beneficiaries to raise reimbursement requests online. The service provider logs in, searches for the beneficiary, scans and fills in beneficiary details, and applies for reimbursement.

The portal allows a service provider to perform the following functions:

* View a list of beneficiary
* Fill in the details scanned from the entitlement voucher
* Upload supporting documents
* Apply for reimbursement
* Track reimbursement status

OpenG2P has a reference implementation for such a service provider portal.

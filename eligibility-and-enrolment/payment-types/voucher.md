# Entitlement Voucher

Many programs disburse cash and other benefits through authorized service providers. These service providers provide cash at the counter, medical assistance, and other such assistance. These service providers need proof from the beneficiary about their entitlement amount and issuing authority.

OpenG2P eases this process with entitlement voucher configuration with built-in support for entitlement voucher templates along with a QR code. To learn the steps for configuring the entitlement voucher template, click here.

The beneficiary carries this entitlement voucher to the service provider, who scans the voucher for the authenticity of the voucher, beneficiary details, entitlement amount, validity time of entitlement, and supporting documents.

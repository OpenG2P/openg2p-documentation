# Payment Rails

## Introduction

Digital payments infrastructure (DPI) could vary from country to country. It is therefore necessary that social benefit delivery systems have the ability to connect to the prevailing DPI and perform G2P payments efficiently. OpenG2P platform provides flexibility to connect to a payment system by writing custom connectors. By default, the platform offers interoperability with the following:

* [Mifos Payment Hub](https://payments.mifos.org/)
* [Mojaloop Payment Switch](https://payments.mifos.org/)
* [GSMA Mobile Money APIs](https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/mobile-money/mobile-money-api/)

# üè¢ Architecture

## Introduction

OpenG2P has a flexible architecture that allows governments and social benefit delivery systems to choose modules per their needs. Using the OpenG2P platform, governments can digitalize the benefit delivery end-to-end and gain significantly in terms of efficiency, ease of administration, speed, cost, and convenience for the beneficiaries. The platform is built for inclusion and has supporting features. For example, beneficiaries in remote areas without network connectivity can be registered offline.&#x20;

**External System Integrations**

Digital authentication can be facilitated using MOSIP or any other ID system because the platform is agnostic of ID systems.

The platform can integrate with payment systems other than those shown in the diagram.

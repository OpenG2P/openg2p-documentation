# üè¢ Architecture

## Functional architecture

OpenG2P has a flexible architecture that allows governments and social benefit delivery systems to choose functionalities as per their needs. The platform is built to allow inclusion and has supporting features. For example, beneficiaries in remote areas without network connectivity can be registered offline. The platform also supports multiple stages of approval with each approval carried out by a different officer.

**External System Integrations**

Digital authentication can be facilitated using MOSIP or any other ID system as the platform is agnostic of ID systems.

The platform can integrate with payment systems other than those shown in the diagram.

# üè¢ Architecture

## Introduction

OpenG2P has a flexible architecture that allows governments and social benefit delivery systems to choose modules per their needs. Using the OpenG2P platform, governments can digitalize the benefit delivery systems end-to-end and gain significantly in terms of efficiency, ease of administration, speed, cost, and convenient for the beneficiaries. The platform is built for inclusion and has supporting features. For example, in remote areas, beneficiaries can be registered offline without network connectivity.

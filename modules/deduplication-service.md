# Deduplication Service

This building block provides an extensible entity resolution framework for finding/matching beneficiaries usually lacking unique identities helping programs deduplicate their beneficiary lists.

Can be used as a standalone component and also integrates with the [OpenG2P ERP](https://docs.openg2p.org/erp)

Government-to-persons programs must be confident of the uniqueness of beneficiaries they serve and avoid double-dipping. A social protection transfer program, as an example, should not be paying the same individual multiple times per period. Yet, this is a significant challenge in countries where universal unique ID coverage, e.g., national ID, is low. The OpenG2P Deduplication Service helps alleviate this and improve confidence in these disbursement lists by using combinations of beneficiaryâ€™s attributes (e.g., name, address, dob) to find high probabilities of duplicates. The strategy employed is called entity resolution and also accounts for typos and representation nuisances in these attributes, e.g., names, addresses, etc

By default, it leverages [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) and [zentity](https://zentity.io/) for entity resolution but provides an easily extensible framework for adopters to add more methods, e.g. fingerprint, facial recognition.

Currently on entity resolution is supported; however we are working on adding fingerprint identification to the set of deduplication strategies.

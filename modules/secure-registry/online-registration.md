# Online registration

## Introduction

For online registration OpenG2P offers a [Self Service Portal ](../self-service-portal.md)where a person logins via his/her ID and then applies for a program. In self service mode, typically, OTP would be used for login. In assisted mode, the registering officer may have biometric devices connected to his/her machine and the registrant can perform biometric authentication in an online manner.&#x20;

Online registration assumes that ID verification service is available to connect via APIs and perform verification of Identity of a person. In case of MOSIP, for e.g, the verification can be done using [eSignet](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/integrations/e-signet) solution.

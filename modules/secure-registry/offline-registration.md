# Offline Registration

## Introduction

OpenG2P offers mechanisms to carry out registrations on the field in areas where Internet connectivity may not be available. The person's information is filled in [ODK](https://getodk.org/) forms on Android devices and submitted to the backend for further processing. The ODK application is integrated with a QR code scanning application that enables automatic population of KYC data of the person in the form along with verification of digital signature establishing the authenticity of the card.

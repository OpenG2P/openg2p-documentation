# Privacy and Security

## Introduction

A registry contains an individual's Personally Identifiable Information (PII) along with very rich  demographic data. It is critical that this data is secure and PII is not shared in human readable form or passed on to other systems without individual's consent. OpenG2P offers secure and private registries to address this concern.

## Security

Data at rest is encrypted using strong cryptographic encryption techniques. The decryption of this data is done in-memory while processing a record such that no trace of the unencrypted data is stored anywhere in the system.

## Privacy

Data is anonymised while being displayed in human readable form (for example, UI screen). Similarly, any query results of a registry are anonymised such that this information cannot be used to specifically target an individual.

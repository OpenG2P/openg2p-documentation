# Schema for Fields

## Context

Personal data is collected across multiple programs (schemes) and often there is fair bit of overlap in the fields of interest, like first name, date of birth, address, phone number etc. It is important that these fields are not duplicated in registry. OpenG2P uses [schemas for fields](https://schema.org/) such that a form is designed using the schemas to avoid storing same records with different names.&#x20;

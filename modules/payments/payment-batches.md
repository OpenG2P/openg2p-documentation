# Payment Batches

## Introduction

In each [payment cycle](payment-cycles.md), the payment transactions are done in batches. There could be several reasons for batching the payments. The transaction limits may be imposed by payment switch, [DFSP](../../glossary.md#dfsp) or any other entity in the payments chain.&#x20;

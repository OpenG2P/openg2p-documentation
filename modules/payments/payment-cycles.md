# Payment Cycles

## Introduction

In a given program, disbursement to beneficiaries is done in cycles. The entire entitlement to a beneficiary may be split into cycles for reasons of availability of funds, certain conditions that beneficiary has to meet or other factors. Further, the beneficiary list may also undergo change in different cycles based on updated eligibility criteria.

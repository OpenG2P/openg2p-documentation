# Eligibility

## Introduction

A given program will have certain criteria to consider individuals eligible for that program. Assuming that eligibility can be defined based on the data collected for the individuals and has unambiguous definition, a program manager can very easily run the criteria on the registry to create a beneficiary list using domain filters and eligibility plugins.

## Eligibility Manager

In OpenG2P, Eligibility Manager is a separate software module where eligibility of a program is configured. If custom plugins are written, they are added to the Eligibility Manager.

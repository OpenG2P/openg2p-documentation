# Eligibility

## Introduction

A given program will have certain criteria to consider individuals eligible for that program. Assuming that eligibility can be expressed unambiguously based on individual's demographic data, a program manager can easily run the criteria on the registry to create a beneficiary list using domain filters and eligibility plugins.

## Eligibility Manager

In OpenG2P, Eligibility Manager is a separate software module where eligibility of a program is configured. If custom plugins are written, they are added to the Eligibility Manager.

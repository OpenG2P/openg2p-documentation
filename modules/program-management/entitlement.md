# Entitlement

## Introduction

Entitlement is the quantity of benefit that a beneficiary is entitled to receive. For cash transfers, this is money that a beneficiary will receive via either direct bank transfer, mobile wallet, cash at counter, vouchers or other disbursement mechanisms. Entitlement is defined for each [cycle](../beneficiary-management/disbursement-cycles.md).

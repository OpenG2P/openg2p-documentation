# Eligibility Assessment

## Introduction

For a given program, there are certain criteria by which individuals are eligible for that program. Assuming that eligibility can be expressed unambiguously based on an individual's demographic data, a program administrator can apply the criteria in the registry to create a list of beneficiaries.&#x20;

## Eligibility Manager

In OpenG2P, Eligibility Manager is a separate software module for configuring eligibility to a program. The module provides both simple filters and more sophisticated filters, such as the [Proxy Means Test](proxy-means-test.md), to define most eligibility requirements. Program administrators can also write their own custom plugins and add them to the Eligibility Manager.

One eligibility manager can be associated with only one program. A separate Eligibility Manager should be created and configured for each program. Follow this guide to create an eligibility manager: [Create Eligibility Manager under Program](../guides/user-guides/create-eligibility-manager-1/).

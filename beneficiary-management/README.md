## Program Management

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

OpenG2P platform's program management is a sequence of processes encompassing program creation to deciding entitlement for the beneficiaries. Digitalization of these processes offers multiple benefits such as ease of administration, agility of operations, and data empowerment to name a few.

### Program management challenges <a href="#program-management-challenges" id="program-management-challenges"></a>

OpenG2P platform's program management module is built to solve the challenges faced by program administrators in their day-to-day operations. Some of the common challenges are:

**Error of exclusion**

The error of exclusion usually happens during registrants' enrollment. For example, a first come first serve approach is easy to monitor and audit, but it may favour registrants with better awareness, approach and access. Furthermore, beneficiaries' income, household size and composition, address, etc. can change over time, but they may not be deemed eligible due to the lack of regular updates.

**Implementing a progressive approach**

A progressive approach works towards the betterment of beneficiaries in the long term. One example is an unemployment assistance program encompassing training, skill development, and job assistance instead of handing out cash benefits to unemployed registrants. This approach is difficult to implement as multiple programs should be monitored in parallel.

#### Categorical targeting

A lot of times, program administrators need to target populations from a specific geographic location, people with debilitating disabilities, or people above/below a specific age. Administrators need filtering criteria to glean this information from existing registrations instead of conducting another costly and time-consuming registration drive.

**Deciding the entitlement amount**

Depending upon the beneficiaries' profile, the benefit amount may vary. Determining eligibility and calculating benefits more often than not require different information. For example, a program for child nutrition is likely to provide more benefits to a family with two children than a family with one child.

**Monopoly in enrolment and entitlement**

Program enrolment and entitlement decisions can be monopolized by a single entity, and hence it is a good practice to digitize and distribute these decisions in a program.

#### Timely notifications

Not notifying beneficiaries about their enrolment and entitlement can leave them confused, and undermines credibility and transparency. This step is often neglected in administrative-driven systems.

## Program management interface

OpenG2P platform has a backend office application for program administrators/managers. Its program management module offers a rich set of functions to define various beneficiary programs, enrolled beneficiaries based on eligibility, calculate entitlements and disburse benefits to the beneficiaries.&#x20;

## Program management features

#### Proxy Means Test

Proxy Means Test is considered the most effective approach to reduce the error of exclusion arising from bias, preferences, and monopoly of the program participants.&#x20;

#### Eligibility filters

OpenG2P supports various eligibility filters to enrol potential beneficiaries based on criteria such as age, gender, household size and composition, and location. Program Administrators can use these filters for Categorical Targeting as well.

#### Indicators

Indicators are a powerful tool for abstracting information from a set of fields. Program Administrators can use indicators to take decisions on the appropriate amount of entitlement for each beneficiary.

#### Multi-stage approvals

To reduce monopoly, Program Administrators can configure multiple stages and assign an assessment role for each stage. OpenG2P has successfully run a pilot program for the Philippines in which three program participants - a social worker, a Cader 1 officer, and a Cader 2 officer, independently assess and approve entitlements.&#x20;

#### Disbursement cycles

OpenG2P platform allows the Program Administrators to divide the benefit disbursements into multiple cycles. Multiple cycles can enable the administrators to easily monitor the program for the effectiveness of enrolments and entitlements.

#### Multiple notification channels

OpenG2P supports both sms-based and email-based notifications for the beneficiaries. In addition, Program Administrators can also send/print Entitlement Vouchers/Guarantee Letters with customized QR codes to establish the authenticity of entitlement.

#### Monitoring multiple programs in parallel

OpenG2P platform allows multiple programs to run in parallel. These programs enrol the registrants from the same registry database. Program administrators can use the [integrated reporting framework](../monitoring-and-reporting.md) to generate reports on registrants, beneficiaries, disbursements, and beneficiary categories, to name a few.

## Assistance unit

OpenG2P defines an assistance unit as an individual or a group. A group may be a household, family or any other group to which the program is targeted.&#x20;

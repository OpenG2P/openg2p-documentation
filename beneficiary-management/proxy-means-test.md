# Proxy Means Test

## Introduction

Proxy Means Test is a method to determine the deprivation/poverty of an individual based on household characteristics. These household characteristics include but are not limited to:

#### Household composition

A household with numerous children and elderly members will incur more expenses. Other factors such as gender, single parent, and age can also play a significant role in making the household vulnerable to poverty.

#### Assets and durable goods

The land, livestock, and other durable goods such as furniture, pieces of equipment, and vehicles owned by the household can act as an indicator of the overall economic condition.

#### Housing conditions

Access to medical facilities, sanitation, electricity, clean drinking water, housing facilities, and economical means of transportation can affect the total expenditure of a household.

#### Employability

Education, employable skills, disability, and health conditions of earning members can affect the total income of a household. These factors should be weighed to assess the total earning potential of a household.

# Enrolment

## Introduction

Enrolment is the process of creating a beneficiary list of individuals or groups by querying the registry and applying eligibility criteria. OpenG2P provides convenient filters and plugins to make the entire process frictionless, convenient and time-saving.

Once the eligibility criterion is configured in the program, the program administrators can enrol the applicants and registrants with a single click of a button.

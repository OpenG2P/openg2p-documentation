# Mojaloop Integration

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

This page describes the integration of OpenG2P with the [Mojaloop](https://mojaloop.io/) switch enabling cash transfer from one bank (treasury bank, for instance) to an individual's bank account. The connection to Mojaloop is achieved via an intermediate interoperability layer like the [Payment Hub](https://payments.mifos.org/) of Mifos.&#x20;

## Functional architecture

Below is the reference architecture of disbursements triggered from OpenG2P resulting in cash transfers.

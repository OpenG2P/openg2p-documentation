# Program Management

## Introduction

OpenG2P platform's program management is a sequence of processes encompassing program creation, registrants into entitled beneficiaries. Digitalization of these processes offers multiple benefits such as ease of administration, agility of operations, and data empowerment to name a few.&#x20;

## Program management challenges

OpenG2P platform's program management module is built to solve the challenges faced by program administrators in their day-to-day operations. Some of the common challenges are:

#### Error of exclusion

Error of exclusion usually happens during enrolling registrants. For example, a first come first serve approach is easy to monitor and audit, but it may favor registrants with better awareness, approach and access. Beneficiaries' income, household size and composition, address, etc. can change over the time and they may be excluded from receiving benefits despite their eligibility due to lack of regular updates.&#x20;

#### Implementing a progressive approach

A progressive approach works towards the betterment of beneficiaries in the long term. One example is an unemployment assistance program encompassing training, skill development, and job assistance instead of handing out cash benefits to the unemployed registrants. This approach is difficult to implement as multiple programs should be integrated and monitored in parallel.

#### Deciding appropriate entitlement amount

Depending upon the beneficiaries' profile, the benefit amount may vary. Determining eligibility and calculating benefits more often than not require different information. For example, a program for child nutrition is likely to provide more benefits to a family with two children than a family with one child.&#x20;

#### Monopoly

Program enrolment and entitlement decisions can be monopolized by a single entity, and hence it is mandatory to digitize and distribute these decisions in a program.&#x20;

#### Working with a limited budget

Program administrators face a problem when they cannot convert all the eligible beneficiaries into beneficiaries receiving benefits/services.&#x20;

#### Timely notifications

Not notifying beneficiaries about their enrolment and entitlement can leave them confused, and undermines the credibility and transparency. This step is often neglected in administrative-driven systems.

## Program management interface

OpenG2P platform has a backend office application for program administrator/managers. Its program management module offers a rich set of functions to define various beneficiary programs, enrolled beneficiaries based on eligibility, calculate entitlements and disburse benefits to the beneficiaries.&#x20;

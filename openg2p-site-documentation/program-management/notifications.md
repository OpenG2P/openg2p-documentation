# Notifications

## Introduction

Notifications to beneficiaries and administrators are a must-have, especially when there are multiple stages of a delivery chain, usually with long time intervals between various stages. The beneficiaries must be informed about their enrolment status, entitlements, disbursements, exit, etc. Multiple methods of notifications may be employed like postal and courier service, SMS, email, and messaging apps.&#x20;

OpenG2P provides in-built support for email and SMS with simple configuration changes. The notifications are triggered at certain default points in the delivery chain, however, depending on the needs of a specific implementation more trigger points may be added.

# Benefit Scheme Administration

## Program Creation

## Participants/Roles in a Program

A program is managed and executed by multiple participants. These participants play one or more of these key roles:

#### Odoo Roles and OpenG2P roles?

#### Field Registration Officer

A field registration officer collects beneficiary information using a mobile registration application. This officer typically goes door-to-door to collect information. The beneficiary information fields are defined by the program manager.

#### Registration Agent

A registration agent collects beneficiary information in the same way as a field registration officer. However, the agent is likely to sit in a central location to be visited by the beneficiaries.

#### Social Worker

#### Program Administrator

An administrator configures role-based access to the OpenG2P portal for other participants as per their roles and may configure default parameters in the portal. Administrators can have different levels of access to the system.

#### Program Manager (Conflict with software Program Manager)

A program manager creates a program and configures deduplication and eligibility parameters in the OpenG2P portal. A program usually has multiple disbursement cycles with a start and end date that are configured by the program manager. In brief, a program manager handles benefit allocation functions during the lifecycle of a program.

#### Payment Manager (Conflict with software Program Manager)

A payment manager is responsible for configuring and managing the cycles, batches, and modes of benefit for the entitled beneficiaries in the OpenG2P portal. This manager also takes care of accounting, reconciliation, and reports related to the benefit payments. In brief, a payment manager handles benefit payment functions during the lifecycle of a program.

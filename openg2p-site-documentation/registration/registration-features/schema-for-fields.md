# Schema for Fields

## Context

Personal data is collected across multiple programs (schemes) and often there is a fair bit of overlap in the fields of interest, like first name, date of birth, address, phone number, etc. It is important that these fields are not duplicated in the registry. OpenG2P proposes to use [schemas for fields](https://schema.org/) such that a form designed using these schemas avoids storing the same records with different names.&#x20;

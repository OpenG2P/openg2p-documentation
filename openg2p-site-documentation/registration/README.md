# Registration

The registration module of OpenG2P offers registration of persons into programs via the following methods:

1. Agent assisted registration&#x20;
2. Self-registration by a potential beneficiary&#x20;
3. API-based registration by other systems

Agent-assisted registration supports [offline registration](broken-reference) in areas where connectivity may be a challenge.

Registration can be done for individuals or groups like families, households, schools, etc.

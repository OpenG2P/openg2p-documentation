[OpenG2P](https://openg2p.org) is an open-source platform that provides the foundation to build government-to-person (G2P) solutions. The roots of the platform lie in the social benefit delivery systems originally developed in response to the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.

The platform offers people-facing processes such as onboarding into schemes, identity verification, and cash transfers to their bank accounts. It also incorporates government department-facing features such as the creation of registries and beneficiary lists, eligibility checks, scheme definition, payment disbursement, and reconciliation.

OpenG2P is a Digital Public Good ([DPG](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/openg2p.html)) recognized by the DPGA and has received contributions and support from multiple organizations and implementers. Its roadmap includes support for non-monetary benefits, proof of delivery, beneficiary management, secure registries, and decision-making support.

The project, co-founded by the Government of Sierra Leone and UNDP and supported by [Mifos](https://mifos.org) in the early stages, is now housed in[ IIIT Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/), a not-for-profit university in India.

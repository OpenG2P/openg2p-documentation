# Program & Beneficiary Management System

## Introduction&#x20;

The Program and Beneficiary Management System (PBMS) is the core module of OpenG2P enabling the management of multiple programs and beneficiaries. The PBMS is based on Odoo ERP/MIS and leverages Odoo's strength of easily extending modules to implement new functionality.  It offers user-friendly interfaces to create and administer social benefit programs.  Some of the key benefits for a country or an organisation using PBMS are:

* Manage multiple programs in one system
* Share beneficiary data with other systems/departments in an interoperable fashion
* Define eligibility and entitlement rules like PMT to automatically create eligible beneficiaries
* Seamlessly connect to payment systems for cash transfer
* Offer self-service portal to residents
* Send notifications to beneficiaries via SM
* Issue digitally signed vouchers to beneficiaries
* Pull data from other sources (departments) to avoid the collection of the same data multiple times

# Monitoring and Reporting

Monitoring the status of programs and registries is vital for program administrators. With OpenG2P's monitoring and logging tools, program administrators can&#x20;

1. Monitor programs via visual dashboards&#x20;
2. Generate reports
3. Monitor system health in real-time&#x20;

The following tools are provided

* [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) for visual pre-configured **dashboards.** [Learn more >>](./#apache-superset)
* Reporting Framework for real-time updates and **slicing and dicing of data.**&#x20;
* Prometheus and Grafana for **system health** monitoring.&#x20;
* Rancher, Fluentd, OpenSearch integration for **system logs** monitoring. [Learn more >>](logging.md)

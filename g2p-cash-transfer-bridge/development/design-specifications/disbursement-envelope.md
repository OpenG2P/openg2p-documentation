# Disbursement-Envelope

Disbursement-Envelope represents a control object that **uniquely defines one instance of disbursement for one disbursement cycle for a benefit program**

A benefit program - in one disbursement cycle - will create exactly one disbursement envelope.

This envelope will represent the control object under which all individual disbursements will be made - for one benefit program - for one disbursement cycle.

The object (and corresponding persistent table) will have the following attributes

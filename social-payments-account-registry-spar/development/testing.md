# Testing

## Unit Testing

We use the pytest framework for Unit Testing. All Unit Tests can be found in the tests folder in the sources github repository.

## Functional Testing

Artefacts relating to Functional Testing can be found here [Test Plans](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SzlkpSnl2E1y9hLOpH\_CeZkVvE9F8qt1). The plan is a Google Spreadsheet that details the test cases. The actual test execution scripts are Postman Scripts and can be found in the Github Repository - [openg2p-spar-mapper-test](https://github.com/OpenG2P/openg2p-spar-mapper-test.git).

You have to import the Postman JSON files into Postman and execute the test cases listed in the Test Plans.

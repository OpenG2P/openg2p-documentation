# Social Registry

Social Registry (SR) is an independent module offered by OpenG2P to enable the creation of **registries** of individuals and groups of people with demographic data with advanced features that make the SR interoperable and easily fit into the digital public infrastructure (DPI) infrastructure of a country.&#x20;

The registry can host demographic data of both individuals and groups (family/household) and this data is privacy protected.  SR offers the unique feature of issuing digitally signed credentials - Verifiable Credentials - to the beneficiaries.

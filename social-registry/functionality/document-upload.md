# Document Upload

Social Registry has a supporting feature that adds and uploads documents. You can use this feature in scenarios such as

* While collecting the demographic information of the registrant.
* The document received via the _**Document Upload**_ feature authenticates the data collected for any program that requires proof of the status. Currently, this feature supports file types such as PDF, .jpeg, .doc, .png, and so on.

The tool kit collects demographic information, adds the relevant documents for authentication purposes, and uploads them in the Social Registry.

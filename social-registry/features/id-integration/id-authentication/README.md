# ID Authentication

The Social Registry (SR) is updated via various mechanisms. The mechanisms such as API, Login-based direct data entry, Registration portal, ODK, and CSV.  It is necessary to confirm that the information provided about the beneficiaries' identities are accurate and that they are currently receiving benefits from the applicable programs. With the ID Authentication feature, SR can check if each beneficiary has validated themselves using biometrics within a specified time frame, allowing it to periodically verify each beneficiary's current status.

Only Registrars, Administrators, and Enumerators are authorised to use National IDs and biometrics or OTPs to authenticate applicants/registrants both in person and virtually.

Note:

The ID Authentication feature avoids the need for self-authentication via self-service portals.

# Dynamic Updates

In Social Registry (SR), the applicants' and registrants' data are received and updated in various ways.&#x20;

The table below provides the mechanism used to receive and update data in SR.

<table><thead><tr><th width="286">Mechanism</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="api/"><strong>APIs</strong></a></td><td>APIs provide automatic updates and real-time data synchronization between systems.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="individuals-and-groups/user-guides/"><strong>Login-based direct data entry</strong></a></td><td>Authorised users can log into the SR module to manually insert or change information. You have direct control over the data and can make changes quickly using this mechanism.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="registration-portal/"><strong>Registration portal</strong></a></td><td>Beneficiaries who have registered can log in to the portal to receive services from service providers, such as organisations or entities. They can manually add and update their details on the portal. </td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../utilities-and-tools/odk-collection-app.md"><strong>ODK</strong></a></td><td><ul><li>ODK (Open Data Kit) can be accessed via Android devices, Agents, and other devices. ODK is a tool that allows for data collection from mobile devices. The ODK Collect app allows enumerators or field workers to collect data offline. The registrant details are uploaded to ODK Central as the agent moves to a place with internet connectivity.</li><li>The ODK Importer is a module built by OpenG2P. It is specifically designed to customise, set up the necessary field depending on the ODK form, and import the beneficiary's pertinent ODK form into OpenG2P Systems using the Social Registry module.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><a href="individuals-and-groups/user-guides/import-csv-file-to-social-registry.md"><strong>CSV</strong></a></td><td>Users can upload a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file with the most recent data to update the Social Registry. This approach is helpful for users with the data in a spreadsheet format or bulk updates.</td></tr></tbody></table>

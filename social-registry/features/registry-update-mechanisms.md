# Registry Update Mechanisms

Social Registry (SR) may be updated in several ways:

* CSV: Users can update the Social Registry by uploading a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file containing the updated information. This method is useful for bulk updates or when users have the data in a spreadsheet format.
* [APIs](api/) : APIs can be used to integrate the Social Registry with other systems or applications. This allows for automated updates and real-time syncing of data between systems.
* Login based direct data entry: Authorized users can log in to the Social Registry system and manually enter or update information. This method provides direct control over the data and allows for immediate updates.
* Operators uploading data:&#x20;
* [ODK ](../../utilities-and-tools/odk-collection-app.md)(Android, agent, offline): ODK  is a set of tools that allows for data collection using mobile devices. Users can collect data offline using ODK Collect and then upload it to the Social Registry system when a connection is available.

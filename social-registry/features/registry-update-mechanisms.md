# Dynamic Updates

In Social Registry (SR), the applicants' and registrants' data are received and updated in various ways.&#x20;

The table below provides the mechanism used to receive and update data in SR.

<table><thead><tr><th width="286">Mechanism</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="api/"><strong>APIs</strong></a></td><td>APIs provide automatic updates and real-time data synchronization between systems.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../functionality/individuals-and-groups/user-guides/README (1).md"><strong>Login-based direct data entry</strong></a></td><td>Authorised users can log into the SR module to manually insert or change information. You have direct control over the data and can make changes quickly using this mechanism.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../functionality/service-provider-portal/"><strong>Registration portal</strong></a></td><td>Beneficiaries who have registered can log in to the portal to receive services from service providers, such as organisations or entities. They can manually add and update their details on the portal. </td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../utilities-and-tools/odk-collection-app.md"><strong>ODK</strong></a></td><td>ODK can be accessed via Android devices, Agents, and so on. ODK is a tool that allows for data collection using mobile devices. Enumerators or field agents can collect data offline using ODK Collect and then upload it to the Social Registry systems when a network connection is available.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../functionality/individuals-and-groups/user-guides/import-csv-file-to-social-registry.md"><strong>CSV</strong></a></td><td>Users can upload a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file with the most recent data to update the Social Registry. This approach is helpful for users with the data in a spreadsheet format or bulk updates.</td></tr></tbody></table>

# Audit Log - Advanced

System needs to log all events of importance for auditing purposes. These logs should be available for a long period of time (as per policy) and it should be possible to retrieve them on demand.

* Level 1 : Basic timestamp, user on created and last updated  (P1)
* Level 2 : Detailed logging of each and every action&#x20;

## Design

It is proposed that MOSIP's Auditmanager service is used for auditing. (TBD).

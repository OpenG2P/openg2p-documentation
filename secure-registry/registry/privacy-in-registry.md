# Privacy in Registry

The increasing digitalization of public services necessitates safeguarding sensitive information, including personally identifiable information (PII), against potential threats. To address this imperative, we have built a security module, an essential component of the OpenG2P system engineered to enhance data security and ensure the privacy of beneficiaries' information.

The OpenG2P Security module seamlessly integrates into the OpenG2P system, bolstering data security by implementing encryption techniques for PII fields. Irrespective of the type of beneficiaries being served, this module's primary focus remains on preserving the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data. Once installed, every PII information record saved in the registry goes through an encryption process such that the data stored in the Database is encrypted.&#x20;

This module also opens up a decryption method that can be used while extending the module for any real-life implementation, assuming appropriate authorization is built around it.

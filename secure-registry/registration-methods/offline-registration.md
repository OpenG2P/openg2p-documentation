# Offline Registration

## Introduction

OpenG2P offers mechanisms to carry out registrations on the field in areas where Internet connectivity may not be available. The person's information is filled in [ODK](https://getodk.org/) forms on Android devices and submitted to the backend for further processing. The ODK application is integrated with a QR code scanning application that enables an automatic population of KYC data of the person in the form along with verification of digital signature establishing the authenticity of the card.

## ODK

ODK is an open source toolkit that uses offline forms to collect data.  ODK Collect is the client-side app while ODK Central is the server-side app.  Learn more about ODK [here](https://docs.getodk.org/).

## Cash grant scenario

A typical flow of enrolling a beneficiary by collecting data on the field by an agent, in offline mode, is illustrated below.

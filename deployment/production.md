# Production

The guide here provides some useful hints for production deployment. However, this guide is not intended to be a comprehensive production deployment handbook. Production deployments vary and implementers of OpenG2P (like System Integrators) have a choice of production configurations, orchestration platforms and components. We also encourage our partners to update this guide based on their learning in the field.

## Postgresql&#x20;

* Number of instances
* Cloud native
* Production configuration

## High availability

Replication of pods for high-availability.

## Security

* Creation of [access channels](deployment-guide/security/access-channel.md).

## Provisioning of VMs

* On cloud assign VMs across subnets for greater resilience to failures.

# Domain mapping on AWS Route53

## Introduction

AWS Route 53 is a highly scalable and reliable Domain Name System (DNS) web service designed to route end users to internet applications by translating human-readable domain names like [www.example.com](http://www.example.com) into IP addresses like 192.0.2.1. It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, providing developers with a robust toolset for managing DNS records, domain registration, and health checking to ensure high availability and performance of web applications.

### Steps

1. Go to Route 53 console on AWS dashboard and select hostedzone. If hostedzone is not created you have to create new one.
2. Click on create record and do mapping according to your environment domain.\

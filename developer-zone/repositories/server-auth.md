# server-auth

Branch: [15.0](https://github.com/OpenG2P/server-auth/tree/15.0)

eSignet integration from OpenG2P uses the [auth\_oidc](https://github.com/OCA/server-auth/tree/15.0/auth\_oidc) package of odoo which is further extended to use [private\_key\_jwt ](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1\_0-15.html#ClientAuthentication)assertion at the client side.

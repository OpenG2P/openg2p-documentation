# Key Manager

## Introduction

OpenG2P recognizes the critical importance of securing sensitive databases, including registrant data and voucher generation. The inclusion of a dedicated Key Manager ensures the protection of private and public keys, enhancing overall system security.

## Key Manager integration

### Purpose

The Key Manager in OpenG2P serves as a centralized entity responsible for the secure storage, generation, and distribution of cryptographic keys. Its primary functions include:

### Securing databases

* Safeguarding databases containing registrant data and voucher generation records.
* Protecting against unauthorized access and ensuring data confidentiality.

### Private and public key management

* Storing and managing private keys used for encryption and digital signatures.
* Distributing public keys for secure communication and verification.

## Implementation steps

### Key generation and storage

1. Utilize the Key Manager to generate strong cryptographic keys.
2. Safely store keys, potentially leveraging Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for added protection.

### Database encryption

1. Employ keys from the Key Manager to encrypt sensitive data in databases.
2. Ensure that only authorized entities with the appropriate keys can access and decrypt the data.

### Voucher generation security

1. Implement secure voucher generation processes using keys managed by the Key Manager.
2. Protect against fraudulent activities by securing voucher generation operations.

### Private/public key pair handling

1. Manage private keys securely to prevent unauthorized access.
2. Distribute public keys for use in secure communication channels within the OpenG2P ecosystem.

## Security best practices

### Key rotation

* Regularly rotate cryptographic keys to mitigate the risk of compromise.
* Ensure a seamless transition during key rotation to avoid disruptions.

### Access control

Define roles and permissions for users interacting with cryptographic keys.

### Monitoring and auditing

* Enable monitoring tools to track key usage and detect anomalies.
* Maintain detailed audit logs for security analysis and compliance purposes.

## HSM integration

Consider integrating with Hardware Security Modules for enhanced physical and logical key protection.

## Docker compose services

## Conclusion

Integrating the Key Manager into OpenG2P provides a robust foundation for securing crucial databases and managing cryptographic keys. By following best practices and leveraging the capabilities of the Key Manager, OpenG2P ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of sensitive information.
